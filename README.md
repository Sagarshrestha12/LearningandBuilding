# Handwritten_digit_recognition Using CNN and Opencv
This project focuses on recognising string of handwritten digits inputed as an image with the help of deeplearning algorithm of Convolutional Neural Network for training the model and opencv for preprocessing the raw inputted image of digits.

## Install
This project requires Python and the following Python libraries installed:
* NumPy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Keras(deeplearning)
* Opencv
If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the python.
## IDE USED -  
* pycharm(for preprocessing image and predictions).
* jupyter notebook(for developing  model).
## Dataset Used
The MNIST database contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images. Half of the training set and half of the test set were taken from NIST's training dataset, while the other half of the training set and the other half of the test set were taken from NIST's testing dataset.
